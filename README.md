I'm Jenny and I'm looking for a job as a Junior Developer.

I'm energetic, enthusiastic and passionate about learning new things.

I graduated from Bristol with a Physics degree in 2011. After a year or so of internships and exploring some new continents, I came back to London and inevitably joined a banking graduate scheme. I built up some valuable professional skills in the Financial Sector but ultimately, I missed the problem solving and complex thinking that I enjoyed so much when I was studying. I started playing around with VBA at work and found it satisfying and creative. I finally felt engaged again and wanted to do more and more programming. I learnt SQL and started learning Python. In July this year I quit my job to join Makers Academy and become a developer. I'm super excited to be starting a career where I get to solve problems and learn new things every day.

I would like to work with friendly open people in a dynamic environment where I can continue build my skills as a developer.

## Skills

#### Analytical


My school and university education provided me with strong numeracy and problem solving skills. In particular, my weekly laboratory sessions allowed me to practice hypothesising, manipulating data and drawing conclusions. Working through mathematical and practical problems strengthened my ability to think logically and laterally as well as developing a good attention to detail.

I have continued to practice and improve these skills throughout my career. My responsibilities at Mako included detailed quantitative analysis of option positions and trading strategies. I also provided data driven p&l analysis and examined market participation for Mako’s new algorithmic market making business.


#### Communication and Teamwork Skills

I am sociable and confident, with experience of working with people from a diverse range of backgrounds and industries. In any context I have always enjoyed meeting new people and working as a team. Communication was a highly important part of my role as a risk manager; much of my day was spent discussing complex market risk and margin issues with traders and presenting conclusions to management. As a product controller, I also collaborated with developers and managed a team of technology consultants on project to launch a new fund and onboard a bespoke order management platform.

#### Initiative and Motivation

I have always been conscientious and curious; I apply myself fully to whatever I am doing. I like to understand things fully and am happy teaching myself. While working at the Royal Bank of Canada, I taught myself VBA, challenged established methods and built macros to streamline processes. At Mako, I worked effectively with no manager, voluntarily taking on responsibility very quickly. I taught myself option theory, risk concepts and SQL. I also initiated the set up of a risk database which is now a crucial part of the risk management process. I am highly ambitious and willing to work hard to achieve goals set by myself and others.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jul 2017 - current)

Makers is a 16 week immersive coding bootcamp which focuses on:

- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Node.js, Angular.js

- Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha

- Test Driven development

- Pair programming

- Object-oriented design and agile methodologies

Makers has been a completely new and exciting way of learning for me. Self-led and teamwork focused, we have certainly faced a steep learning curve. It has helped me understand that with the right kind of approach, you can learn any language yourself. In week 6 for example, we were told to simply build an Airbnb clone in Javascript, a language that none of us had seen before - on Monday I didn't have a clue what "Node" was, by Friday we had a functional (but not pretty!) TDD'd website.

#### University of Bristol (Sep 2008 - Jul 2011)

Physics BSc (Hons) 2:1 (68%)

My final year project “Stretching Molecules in a Computer” involved building a model of a polymer in C with my lab partner. We both achieved strong 1sts and had a lot of fun working together.  Unbeknown to me at the time, this was my first pairing experience!

#### Westminster School (Sep 2006 - Jul 2008)

4As at A-level: Economics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics

#### Alleyn's School (Sep 2001 - Jul 2006)

8A*s and 2As at GCSE

## Hobbies and Interests

**Sports**

I enjoy playing netball, tennis, yoga, skiing, rock climbing and triathlons. I am a sports enthusiast and am always encouraging others to participate! Organised several sporting events for Mako: favourites include the Tour of Cambridgeshire Gran Fondo and Tower 42 Vertical Rush!

**Volunteering**

At school, I participated in a weekly care group for handicapped children. I also provided live-in care for disabled guests at a week long holiday camp - an amazing and eye opening experience. From 2013 - 2016 I attended schools in London with Numbers and Reading Partners; a teaching initiative to engage children with Maths and reading.

**Travel**

I am passionate about travel and outdoor adventures. I spent an amazing 6 months exploring South America, China and South-East Asia after graduating. I trekked through stunning landscapes, tried weird and wonderful cuisines and got to experience and learn from cultures so different to my own. I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to explore these amazing corners of the earth, but this year I want to spend some time seeing the beautiful places in the UK.
