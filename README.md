I'm Jenny and I'm looking for a job as a Junior Developer.

I'm energetic, enthusiastic and passionate about learning. I want to be a developer because I love problem solving and I'm good at it. I'm super excited to be starting a career where I get to solve problems and learn new things every day.

Have a look at my website [here](https://about-me-jb.herokuapp.com/)!

I would like to work with friendly open people in a dynamic environment where I can continue build my skills as a developer.

## Skills

#### Analytical
- While studying Physics, working through mathematical and practical problems strengthened my ability to think logically and laterally. In the lab, we practiced hypothesising, manipulating data and drawing conclusions.
- At my previous company (options trading), I was responsible for producing data-driven quantitative analysis of options positions and trading strategies.
- I am good at breaking a problem down into manageable pieces - this is a crucial part of object-oriented design and writing clean readable code that is easy to adapt and test.


#### Communication and Teamwork Skills
- I'm sociable and confident while still being a good listener.
- As a risk manager, communication was extremely important - much of my day was spent discussing complex market risk issues with traders and presenting conclusions to management.
- I also have experience collaborating with developers and technology consultants, as last year I led a project to launch a new fund.
- Over the last 12 weeks, I've had lots of experience talking about code and programming concepts both with developers and people not from a technology background.


#### Initiative and Motivation

- I have always been conscientious and curious; I apply myself fully to whatever I am doing.
- On my banking graduate scheme, I saw opportunities for increased efficiency in the Operations department; I taught myself VBA so I could build some macros and challenge established processes.
- When I moved into Risk, I did not have a direct manager. I took on responsibility very quickly and learnt a range of new skills and concepts with very little guidance.
- I am highly ambitious and willing to work hard to achieve goals set by myself and others.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jul 2017 - current)

- I have just completed my twelve amazing but exhausting weeks at Makers. Self-led and teamwork focused, we've learnt about Test Driven Development, Object-Oriented Design, Agile methodologies and pair programming.
- Technologies: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Node.js, Swift, Html, CSS, Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, PostrgreSQL, Mongo DB, Github, Trello
- It's not only coding skills I've gained along the way but a new approach to learning; knowing where to start, what to try, when to ask for help and when to persevere.
- It has helped me understand that with the right kind of approach, you can learn any language yourself. In week 6 for example, we were told to simply build an Airbnb clone in Javascript, a language that none of us had seen before. On Monday I didn't have a clue what "Node" was, by Friday we had a functional (but not pretty!) TDD'd website.

#### University of Bristol (Sep 2008 - Jul 2011)

Physics BSc (Hons) 2:1 (68%)

My final year project “Stretching Molecules in a Computer” involved building a model of a polymer in C with my lab partner. We both achieved strong 1sts and had a lot of fun working together.  Unbeknown to me at the time, this was my first pairing experience!

#### Westminster School (Sep 2006 - Jul 2008)

4As at A-level: Economics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Physics

#### Alleyn's School (Sep 2001 - Jul 2006)

8A*s and 2As at GCSE

## Interests

**Sports**

I enjoy playing netball, tennis, yoga, skiing, rock climbing and triathlons. I am a sports enthusiast and am always encouraging others to participate! Organised several sporting events for Mako: favourites include the Tour of Cambridgeshire Gran Fondo and Tower 42 Vertical Rush!

**Volunteering**

At school, I participated in a weekly care group for handicapped children. I also provided live-in care for disabled guests at a week long holiday camp - an amazing and eye opening experience. From 2013 - 2016 I attended schools in London with Numbers and Reading Partners; a teaching initiative to engage children with Maths and reading.

**Travel**

I am passionate about travel and outdoor adventures. I spent an amazing 6 months exploring South America, China and South-East Asia after graduating. I trekked through stunning landscapes, tried weird and wonderful cuisines and got to experience and learn from cultures so different to my own.
